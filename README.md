# Pokemon Team Builder App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.  This application allows Pokemon players to keep track of their teams via web application.  With the ability to browse through every pokemon (the first 1010 at the time of release) and customize each's stats to the user's liking, there has never been a better companion tool for competitive Pokemon players.  

To run this application locally:
```
npm run dev
```

This application utilizes Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL (Neon), tRPC, Tailwind, and Clerkjs.

## Notes:
-Tera types and other generational features have been overlooked in favor of future proofing this application.  Possible plans to add them in the future
